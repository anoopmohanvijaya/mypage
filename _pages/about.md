I am a fluid dynamicist with a PhD in Aerospace Engineering from IIT Madras, India. My research areas are: fluid flows with turbulence, waves and instabilities, and flows that are of geophysical relevance. I have expertise in experimental methods as well as CFD. I have been leading a theoretical study on Rossby waves in laboratory jets as well. Recently, I have been exploring implementation of ML methods for weather models. 

I tell people that I am an explorer in quiet ways. I am a weekend footballer, fortnightly biker and an occasional hiker. I am a tea person, interested in tea-chats on politics, science, football, (motor)cycling and philosophy.
